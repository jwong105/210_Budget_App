# My Personal Project

## A Budget App

A *bulleted* list:
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  Note that the IntelliJ markdown previewer doesn't seem to render 
the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.

For my personal project, **I propose a budget desktop app which will record all your expenses for each month and return 
how much was spent that month when called**. The user will specify a budget they would like to stay in for the month, and 
the budget app will notify the user when that budget limit has been reached. It will also intake the user's bank balance
and deduct the recorded expenses from their account. It will also add to that balance when the user earns money say 
from payroll.

**This app is designed for anyone** to use who want to track their expenses and hopefully spend less as a result by being 
aware of how much they are spending. 

This project is of interest to me, because **as a student who is responsible for their own living and tuition expenses, 
budgeting is the key to managing expenses**. It lets me track how much money I have spent and prevents me from 
overspending unnecessarily.
