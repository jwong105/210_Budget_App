# My Personal Project

## A Budget App

## What does this application do?
For my personal project, **I propose a budget desktop app which will record all your expenses made in each month and 
return how much of your budget is remaining or how if you have gone over budget**. The user will set a budget they would
like to stay within for the month, and can continue to add expenses made throughout the month. At the end, the user can 
view all their expenses made throughout the month.

## Who is this application for?
**This app is designed for everyone to use**, especially those who like to be organized and track their expenses. By 
recording how much one spends in a month, this app will hopefully help others in their quest to save money.

This project is of interest to me, because **as a student who is responsible for their own living and tuition expenses, 
budgeting is the key to managing all these expenses**. It lets me track how much money I have spent and prevents me from 
accidentally overspending.
